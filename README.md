# PersonalHomePage
A Personal website with information about my work experience, skills and personal projects with a slight twist. 
Instead of simply using a static front-end to display the content, information will be stored in a database (currently sqlite3
for development purposes, but the the live site may use MySql or Postgresql) and accessed using backend powered by Flask (python).

Dynamically downloaded content can be changed from a password protected admin page. Currently running locally.
