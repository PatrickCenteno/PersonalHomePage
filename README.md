# PersonalHomePage

My code for my personal webpage. Instead of being a simple static front end, will utilize a flask backend.  I can change 
all of my information through a password protected admin page and all content will be stotred a database. Currently its sqlite 
but I may change in the future. Currently in development and not live.
